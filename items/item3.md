Third Project
===

This is a mock portfolio idea. This idea originated in my first term and it is the goal for the final look of my portfolio. I think that this is a very good template to follow becuase it does not only look very simple but it is also original. I am personally a fan of the one page layout just because if an employer is looking for all my information it will all be displayed for him. Especially when coding my own portfolio, I dont want anything to be hidden because I made a mistake in my coding. Therefore I think the one page layout is the best way to go.

My Angle
===

I hope that by the end of my second year I am fully able to uptain this portfolio, I still do not believe enough in my coding skills to get it how I want. Therefore, I would rather wait and be patient and make sure I have a product that I am satisdied with before publishing anything.
