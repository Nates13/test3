First Project
===

This project was given to my team in our first year at the University. We were challeneged with redeisigning a the mall in the downtown core so that it was more student based. We learned as well as applied all of our concepts to the project. Creating mind maps, personnas and other forms of empathy maps, we were able to come up with many idea as to how we will tackle this issue. 

My Angle
===

This project was quite interesting, my main role in the porject was being a researcher. Being a researcher, i conducted interviews, analyzed feedback and conducted prototype testing.
