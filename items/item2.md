Second Project
===

This was a website that I fromatted to my liking. The challenge was to use CSS and apply our knowledge to the website. We had to style fonts, create new backgrounds and edit the colours throughout the website so everything matched. The goal of the colour scheme is to have three colours that correspond. I chose yellow, dark grey and white because I find that the colour of grey and yellow go very well together, along with that I added white because it is a very neutral colour which allowed for a seemless third colour added. 

My Angle
===

Coding is definitly not my strong suit, the beginning of my second year at University was the first time ever learning these languages. I continue to struggle learning how to code but my drive to be apart of a strong UX firm is what pushes me to become better.
